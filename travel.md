# Travel Hacks


I originally wrote up my [travel hacks](travel2015.md)  7 years ago. I recently revisited this page and realized that much of it is out of date. For starters, the pandemic has dramatically changed my travel frequency and routine, and many of the products I wrote about are now outdated. So here’s my 2022 version. 


## Air travel

I’ve cut my travel substantially since the pandemic started. I also plan to travel much less going forward because of climate reasons. My goal is to attend a few high-value meetings in person and remotely participate in the rest. 

As an elder millennial, my rule for air travel is to fly with the fewest connections (cost is not a factor), through big hubs (for redundancy), and only on carriers where I have high status. If a meeting cannot accommodate my travel preferences, I skip those meetings.


### Luggage

I still stand by my [Minaal carry-on](https://www.minaal.com/products/carry-on-bag-3?variant=35008575864989) for most short trips. I tack on a small carry-on suitcase for longer trips. I use various camera cubes to pack camera gear into these unless I choose to travel with a large camera backpack for photography trips.

## Jetlag / Sleep

I do my best to minimize jet lag. With help from my primary care doctor, I’ve figured out ways to minimize jetlag.

a) **If you’re landing before noon at your destination (TLDR: Sleep much of the plane ride)**  
- Eat a substantial meal at the airport. Try to avoid eating on the plane as much as possible.  
- Do anything else to stay awake for a couple of hours, then take an Ambien (you’ll need a prescription from your doctor first), and fall asleep. Make sure there are at least 6 more hours on the flight so you’ll have time to wake up _before_ landing.
- Have coffee at your destination, then eat a giant breakfast.  
- This allows me to stay up till past 10 pm at my destination and my cycle is reset when I fall asleep. I sometimes take half an Ambien the first night to make sure I stay asleep through the night.

b) **If landing at the destination late afternoon to evening**:  
There is no set recommendation here but don’t sleep much on the plane. Definitely nap for a couple of hours here and there but stay awake and watch as many bad movies as possible. Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Then eat a light dinner at the destination and take an Ambien and get to bed at 10 pm or after. 

**Other relevant gear**:
- [Manta Sleep Mask](https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask). These are super nice and compact and have replaced my previous recommendation of an Ostrich Pillow. The large eye cups put zero pressure on your eyes. 
- [Airfly](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/airfly) So I can still use my own headphones with airplane tv consoles.

## Tech

### Chargers

- As I have mostly switched to a USB-C world (other than my iPhone which I expect will change in version 14), all my old chargers have been replaced by Anker 6ft braided cables (I carry at least 4 of them) and [Anker Gan bricks](https://www.anker.com/ganprime?ref=naviMenu). 
- I have a small [Anker 622 Magnetic Battery (MagGo)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Foldable-Wireless-Interstellar/dp/B09925S3R9) for on-the-go charging but I’m mostly just good topping off when I’m near power.

I keep everything in a [Electronic Dopp Kit](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/tech-pouch/?variant=11531003166764) from Peak Design. I also have a small router, flat ethernet cable, additional small cables, extra yubikey, spare sd cards, and adapters to convert USB-A → USB-C (and the other way around).  The real pro tip is to leave this packed and ready at all times and not use your everyday chargers/cables here (the same rule applies to a regular Dopp kit).

#### Air Tags
I have AirTags hidden in all of my bags. [Moment AirTag holders](https://www.shopmoment.com/airtags) are really nice to mount in hard-to-find spots. My home is a significant location so it doesn’t alert me when I leave things behind here, but it will when I travel. 

### SIM cards

In the past, I would grab sim cards at airports. I no longer do that. I keep my Verzion travel plan on as I need to stay in touch with family. I also grab a country-specific [eSim](https://www.airalo.com/) for data, which has now become so easy.

### Apps & Services

* [TripIt Pro](https://www.tripit.com/pro) Sadly in 2022, there isn’t a good alternative to TripIt. The app feels abandoned but there is no better way to collate all travel plans in one place. I still use it, but have turned off all notifications as I find their travel updates very slow and useless (more on this below).
* [Flighty](https://www.flightyapp.com/) has replaced the TripIt gate and schedule notifications completely. It’s expensive but the UI is amazing, notifications are blazing fast, and it has so much more information, like tracking the aircraft 25 hours before departure, on-time stats, and more.
* [Seat Alerts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seat-alerts/id533533342) I’ve always been picky about seats, but more so since the pandemic started. For most aircraft bodies and airline-specific configurations, I know exactly where I want to sit. If you feel the same way and miss out on your ideal seats, $0.99 (per flight) on this app will get you an alert for all your preferred seats so you can grab them asap.
* Global Entry Appointments: If it’s hard to find an appointment for a renewal, [appointment scanner](https://appointmentscanner.com/) is totally worth the $29. You can easily find one within a few days of signing up. 

### Apple Watch Face

- I have a [focus mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608) for travel that triggers when I enter the San Francisco airport geofence or open a travel app. It switches all my home screen apps and also my watch face. More on this [here](https://matthewbischoff.com/travel-focus-mode/)

## Misc Best Practices

- **First Aid**: Keep a small first aid kit in your pack. I stock mine with travel-sized refills of the [most common medications](https://www.rescue-essentials.com/medications-unit-dose-pack/), Advil, Tylenol, Zyrtec, and Benadryl (all in branded, sealed, single-use packets). I’ve spent a lot of time looking for a pharmacy at odd hours in random countries and still failed to find the right meds. I now keep a small laminated checklist and top off this kit before each trip.
- **A covid kit** I also carry at least two rapid tests per day of travel and schedule PCR tests before departure and after my return. I also carry an Aranet Co2 monitor to make sure meeting rooms have good ventilation.
- **A second wallet**: Hidden in my pack is always a second wallet with an alternate ID, credit + debit card, and some cash.
- **A quick map of relevant locations**: Before I travel I make sure to mark my hotels on a Google map for $city and save that to a list named after the city. I take a couple more minutes to quickly find the nearest emergency room, pharmacy, and healthy grocery store and save those. If I have more time, I’ll mark up all the nice restaurants as well. You’ll be surprised at how handy this turns out to be. When you’re walking around your hotel/the city and want to grab some water/food/drinks/snacks, you’ll know where to go instead of trying to research spots while standing on a street corner. This doesn’t have to be an extensive, serendipity-killing process.
