# Using [Airalo](https://ref.airalo.com/Wx86) for International Cellular Data

Follow these step-by-step instructions to use [Airalo](https://ref.airalo.com/Wx86) for cellular data while traveling internationally and avoid Verizon's travel pass charges. Travel pass is $10 a day. For most places, the same 10 bucks on Airalo will cover you for an entire week. 

## Before Your Trip 🧳

1. Install the Airalo eSIM in advance of your trip. It (mostly likely) won't activate until it connects to a supported network at your destination. Some will activate instantly.
2. Once the Airalo eSIM is installed, turn it off in `Settings > Cellular` until before takeoff.
3. Turn off data roaming on your Verizon line in `Settings > Cellular >` select your Verizon line.
4. In `Settings > Messages`, turn off `"Send as SMS"` to prevent iMessage from converting to SMS if it fails.
5. Keep TravelPass on as a failsafe to limit accidental roaming charges.
6. To conserve cellular data abroad, turn off "Wi-Fi Assist" in `Settings > Cellular` (scroll to the bottom).
7. To use Verizon Wi-Fi Calling, turn it on while still in the US and connected to a Verizon tower, in `Settings > Cellular >` select your Verizon line.
8. (Optional) Install the Google Voice app in the US and set it to "prefer data" for low-cost calls abroad.

## At the Airport Before Takeoff 🛫

1. Connect to the airport's Wi-Fi.
2. Turn your Airalo eSIM back on in `Settings > Cellular`.
3. Set cellular data to your Airalo line in `Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data`.
4. Turn off `"Cellular Data Switching"` in the same settings section.
5. Keep your Verizon line on to use iMessage & Wi-Fi Calling with your Verizon number.
6. Confirm data roaming is turned on for your Airalo line in the same settings section.

## At Your Destination 🛬

1. After landing and exiting airplane mode, your Airalo eSIM should automatically connect. If not, try toggling airplane mode.
2. When connected to Wi-Fi, confirm your Verizon line says "Verizon Wi-Fi" in the control panel before making Wi-Fi calls/texts.
3. When not on Wi-Fi, **don't answer incoming calls or make outgoing calls/SMS on your Verizon line**. It will immediately trigger a $10 travel pass. Instead, use data messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Voice, or iMessage.

By following these steps, you should avoid Verizon roaming charges. Turning off data roaming will prevent Verizon data roaming, but you will still receive calls and texts on your Verizon line. Just don't answer calls, make outgoing calls, or send SMS texts unless your Verizon line is in Wi-Fi Calling mode.
