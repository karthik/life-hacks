# Tools I use regularly

- [Typinator](https://ergonis.com/typinator)
	- A fantastic text expander. Not only does it do simple text expansions but you can write out complex formulas. I have not typed out my name, email, phone, address, expanded acronyms and so much more in many years. 


## Mac Only
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)
	- *My calendar software of choice. Mac Only. The calendars still come from my various GSuites, but I get to group them and turn them off as needed (vacation/work), propose times, and use natural language to set up appointments. Time to leave (for real-world meetings) is a great little addition* 
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)
	- *I’ve used it for a very long time and it is my second brain for tasks. It doesn’t allow for collaboration (which is a deal breaker for many) but for solo use, it is lovely.*
- [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/)
	- *A tool that runs in the background and automatically cleans up folders. I’ve used this for over a decade and often forget that it still runs silently behind the scenes. It can clean up your downloads folder, organize your Desktop, and so much more via custom recipes.*
- [Pop Clip](https://www.popclip.app/)
	- *A popover menu that appears anytime you select any text. It’s great to search directly on a particular site, word counts a block of text, dictionary search, fill the screen, and so much more via [extensions](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/).*
- [Soulver](https://soulver.app/)
	- *By far the best back-of-the-envelope calculator. I can build a budget in minutes compared to writing formulas in Excel or Google Sheets. e.g.* `140k USD + 14% overhead in AUD`
- [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro)
	- *Resize windows with keyboard shortcuts.*
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)
	- *Keeps your menubar clutter-free.* 
- [Fuzzytime](https://marcusolovsson.com/fuzzytime/)
	- The menubar clock feels a lot less intimidating. I get reminders for meetings so I don’t want to know the exact time. 
- [Übersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)
	- This is a bit old school but I can use existing widgets (or write my own) and place lots of information directly onto my Desktop wallpaper. 


## Web services

- [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/referrals/A7P6BNK3)
	- *I use it to transcribe calls so I can reference materials later. While [Whisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) can run locally for a lot less, just the bookkeeping and import makes Otter a better option for the time being.*
- [Speechify](https://share.speechify.com/mzsrAvQ)
	- *This seemed a bit weird at first and I didn’t expect it to stick. But now I love listening to my documents and editing with a fresh perspective. I also love queuing up a few articles into Speechify and going for a walk. I get plenty of work-related reading done and also a nice walk and fresh air. It is a fantastic way to edit because I get to hear it out loud and catch more issues around flow and logic than I can from reading the same text a dozen times.*
